<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Fernglen, named after the family home in England, was purchased by the Fisher family in July 1888. The property consisted of a mix of native bush and scrubland. Part of the scrubland was cleared for market gardening and grazing, and the native bush area was interplanted with pohutukawa, rimu and kahikatea in the early 1920s.</p>

<p>Fernglen has been used for education and research since the 1920s by such people as T.F. Cheeseman of the Auckland Museum, Professor Lancaster of the Auckland University, H.B. Dobbie, Frank Fisher and his son William and by Muriel Fisher. More about the HISTORY.</p>

<h2 id="education-centre">Education Centre</h2>

<p>The Education Centre was completed in 1997 thanks to the Birkenhead Rotary Club.</p>

<p>Fernglen is visited by many people from horticultural groups, Unitec students and schoolchildren. It became clear that Fernglen required a building that could cater for schoolchildren as well as visitors.</p>

<p>It was Fernglen&rsquo;s very good fortune that Peter Thomas a member of the Birkenhead Rotary Club, took a keen interest in the gardens. When he heard about the number of schoolchildren visiting Fernglen, he suggested to the Birkenhead Rotary Club that this would be a worthy project for their organisation to raise funds for. The idea was accepted and through the fund-raising effort of the Birkenhead Rotary Club and supported by the former North Shore City Council, Auckland Savings Bank, Utility Corporation and other well-wishers the project came together.

<h2 id="friends-of-fernglen">Friends of Fernglen</h2>

<p>As Fernglen grows, it needs continued support from interested members of the community. One way to show your support is by signing the visitorsâ€™ book in the gazebo.</p>

<p>Another way is by becoming a member of the Friends of Fernglen. More about the FRIENDS OF FERNGLEN</p>
